#First set ref.txt 

# image_df: image pixels are stored as dataframe 
STEPS: 
1> move train.csv ,test.csv, sample.csv to models_  [make name train,test,sample]
2> decide: 
id_name : as that of train id columns 
target_name : as that of sample target column 
-----------Make format like below exactly ----------------------
train: ImageId, Label, pixel0, pixel1, pixel2, ... , pixel200,  
test: ImageId, pixel0, pixel1, pixel2, ... , pixel200 
sample: ImageId, Label
3> run keys.py after setting appropriate name of variables
4> run create_folds.py to create [my_folds.csv]


# image_path: there is train.csv and sample.csv folder which contains image name 
and there are image folders
initially>
(before putting image ID column do sample(frac=1))
train.csv: image_id, target 
sample.csv: image_id, fake_target
target_name >> sample target name 
id_name >> sample id name 

STEPS:
1> move train.csv to models_ by first rename id_name to 
image1.jpeg 
2> move sample.csv to models_ as test.csv by first renaming id_name to
image2.jpeg 
3> move sample to models_ [image_id, target]

4> run keys.py after setting appropriate name of variables
5> run create_folds.py to create [my_folds.csv]


# image folder


# Note:- 
keep [self.valid_preds] and [spyelf.test_preds]
